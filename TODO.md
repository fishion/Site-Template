# TODO

- incorporate rand templat var for cache invalidation?
- look at warnings when running npm i from scratch
- How am I making sure I have type safety using tsx over ts-node
- Develop AI md files to guide the AI and set up desired behaviour

- add a script to follwo instructions in README and set up a new project from this template
- Basic CI for publishing to cloudflare pages (friends of knoll park has one)
- Lint .json
- Test partials path in webpack
- No testing framework (Jest, Vitest, etc.)

- Mixed .js + .ts Controllers - Your webpack config searches for both index.ts and index.js and merges them. This is unusual - typically you'd standardize on one or the other. I'm relaxed about this for now - it's by design - but maybe change once everything fully on TS?
